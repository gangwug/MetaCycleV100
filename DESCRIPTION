Description: This package provides two functions-meta2d and meta3d for
    detecting rhythmic signals from time-series datasets. For analyzing
    time-series datasets without individual information, 'meta2d' is 
    suggested, which incorporates ARSER, JTK_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle in the
    detection of intereseted rhythms. For analyzing time-series datasets with
    individual information, 'meta3d' is suggested, which takes use of 
    Lomb-Scargle to analyze time-series data individual by individual and 
    gives out integrated values based on analysis result of each individual.
