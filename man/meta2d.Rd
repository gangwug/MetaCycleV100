\item{infile}{a character string. The name of input file containing
time-series data.}

\item{outdir}{a character string. The name of directory used to store

\code{\link[stats]{ar}} fit of \code{"ARS"}, must be one of
\code{"auto"}(use MLE depending the number of time points), \code{"mle"}

interested rhythm, which is a necessary parameter for \code{ARS}. The
default is \code{24}(for circadian rhythms). Set it to another proper
numeric value for other rhythms.}

added in the output files.}

\item{outSymbol}{a character string. A common prefix exists in the names of
output files.}
}
\value{
\code{meta2d} will store analysis results in different files under
  \code{outdir} instead of returning them as objects. Files named with
  "ARSresult", "JTKresult" and "LSreult" store analysis results from
  \code{ARS}, \code{JTK} and \code{LS} respectively. The file named with
  "CirOmicsresult" is integration file, and it stores integrated values in
  columns with a common name-"CirOmics". The integration file also
  contains p-value, FDR value, period, phase(adjusted phase if
  \code{adjustedPhase = "predictedPer"}) and amplitude values calculated
  by each method.

\description{
This is a function that incorporates ARSER, JTK_CYCLE and Lomb-Scargle to
  detect rhythmic signals from time-series datasets.
}
\details{
\href{https://github.com/cauyrd/ARSER}{ARSER}(Yang, 2010),
  \href{http://openwetware.org/wiki/HughesLab:JTK_Cycle}{JTK_CYCLE}(
  Hughes, 2010), and
  \href{http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/2005/LombScargle/}{
  Lomb-Scargle}(Glynn, 2006) are three popular methods of detecting
  rhythmic signals. \code{ARS} can not analyze unevenly sampled datasets,
  or enenly sampled datasets but with missing values, or with replicate
  samples, or with non-integer sampling interval. \code{JTK} is not
  suitable to analyze unevenly sampled datasets or evenly sampled datasets
  but with non-integer sampling interval. If set \code{analysisStrategy}
  as \code{"auto"}(default), \code{meta2d} will automatically select
  proper method from \code{cirMethod} for each input dataset. If the user
  clearly know that the dataset could be analyzed by each method defined
  by \code{cirMethod} and do not hope to output integrated values,
  \code{analysisStrategy} can be set as \code{"selfUSE"}.

\code{ARS} used here is translated from its python version which always
  uses \code{"yule-walker"}, \code{"burg"}, and \code{"mle"} methods(see
  \code{\link[stats]{ar}}) to fit autoregressive models to time-series
  data. Fitting by \code{"mle"} will be very slow for datasets
  with many time points. If \code{ARSmle = "auto"} is used,
  \code{meta2d} will only include \code{"mle"} when number of time points
  is smaller than 24. In addition, one evalution work(Wu, 2014) indicates
  that \code{ARS} shows relative high false positive rate in analyzing
  high-resolution datasets (1h/2days and 2h/2days). \code{JTK}(version 1)
  used here is minorly modified for easing its p-value calculation problem
  in analyzing datasets with missing values(reporting more significant
  p-values). \pkg{MetaCycle} will add a new version of \code{JTK}(may
  provide a better solution for this problem) when it is released.

The power of detecting rhythmic signals for an  algorithm is associated
  with the nature of data and interested periodic pattern(Deckard, 2013),
  which indicates that integrating analysis results from multiple methods
  may be helpful to rhythmic detection. For integrating p-values,
  Bonferroni correction(\code{"bonferroni"}) and Fisher's method(
  \code{"fisher"}) (Fisher, 1925; implementation code from \pkg{MADAM})
  could be selected, and \code{"bonferroni"} is usually more conservative
  than \code{"fisher"}. The integrated period is arithmetic mean of
  multiple periods. For integrating phase, \code{meta2d} takes use of
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_of_circular_quantities}{
  mean of circular quantities}. Integrated period and phase is further
  used to calculate the baseline value and amplitude through fitting a
  constructed periodic model.

Phases given by \code{JTK} and \code{LS} need to be adjusted with their
  predicted period (\code{adjustedPhase = "predictedPer"}) before
  integration. If \code{adjustedPhas = "notAdjusted"} is selected, no
  integrated phase will be calculated. If set \code{weightedPerPha} as
  \code{TRUE}, weighted scores will be used in averaging periods and
  phases. Weighted scores for one method are based on all its reported
  p-values, which means a weighted score assigned to any one profile will
  be affected by all other profiles. It is always a problem of averaging
  phases with quite different period lengths(eg. averaging two phases
  with 16-hours' and 30-hours' period length). Currently, setting
  \code{minper}, \code{maxper} and \code{ARSdefaultPer} to a same value
  may be the only way of completely eliminating such problem.

This function is originally aimed to analyze large scale perodic data(
  eg. circadian transcriptome data) without individual information.
  Please pay attention to data format of input file(see \code{Examples}
  part). Except the first column and first row, others are time-series
  experimental values(setting missing values as \code{NA}).
